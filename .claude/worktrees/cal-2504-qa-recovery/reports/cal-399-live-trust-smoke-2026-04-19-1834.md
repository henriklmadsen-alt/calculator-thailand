## Verdict

FAIL (release trust is not healthy)

## Critical Defects (Release Blockers)

1. Apex custom domain remains unreachable.
   - `https://kamnuanlek.com/` -> timeout/unreachable (`This operation was aborted`)
   - `https://kamnuanlek.com/__release` -> timeout/unreachable (`This operation was aborted`)
   - Apex visual matrix failed `12/12` captures (desktop + mobile across required route set)
   - Recommended owner: [CAL-197](/CAL/issues/CAL-197)

2. Release attestation endpoint `/__release` is unavailable on active release hosts.
   - `https://www.kamnuanlek.com/__release` -> `404`
   - `https://calculator-thailand-production.up.railway.app/__release` -> `404`
   - `verify-railway-release` timed out at `45s` on both hosts (`exit_code=1`)
   - Expected SHA checked: `cd6486339ca6382aeab2cf26a17f221e851a3083`
   - Recommended owner: [CAL-197](/CAL/issues/CAL-197)

3. Transfer-fee calculator route remains broken on live hosts.
   - Route: `/%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B3%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%93%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%9A%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99/`
